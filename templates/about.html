            homes and rooms according to their requirement and let them advertise their vacant
            rooms/house using web browsers.
            In present scenario customer have to visit different places in search of rooms and the owners
            of the house also have to make many contacts to get a decent people/family.
            So, using "ROOMZY" website customer can search rooms online according to their
            requirement.
            For additional information and deals they can directly contact to the owner of the house since
            all the contact details of owner are displayed in the advertisement along with the room/house
            detail, which will definitely save the valuable time of both the searchers and the renters.
