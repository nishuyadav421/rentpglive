            homes and rooms according to their requirement and let them advertise their vacant
            rooms/house using web browsers.

            of the house also have to make many contacts to get a decent people/family.

            all the contact details of owner are displayed in the advertisement along with the room/house
            detail, which will definitely save the valuable time of both the searchers and the renters.
